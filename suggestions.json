Of course you could argue that other ranks have a large gap as well, such as some of the later ones, but for people like me who have roughly 1500 weight, they might feel like the jump between 700 and 1500 hundred isn't given enough credit. What I'm suggesting is a rank in between, or a lowering of the professor weight requirements (but I wouldn't recommend this, as the next tank is already double the weight) I don't feel like my stage of the game, where I'm not early game, but not mid game really either, is recognized enough. It's always early or mid, but no range between that. Thanks for reading <:hypixel_big_grin:801622094533492777>",

        "suggestion": "It seems like a decent amount of people are being scammed and when I was scammed it sucked. Luckily enough I was able to sell the materials I was scammed with and with a donation of 2 mil I was able to make my money back I lost in a day bazar flipping. But that two mil was really helpful in getting back up on my feet. I think it would be useful if there was like a pool of money that people could donate to that if someone is scammed, they would be given some of that money from that pool to help get them back to where they were. They would be limits and the mods would decide if you were scammed enough to get money and how much that would be. And if the victim needs the money because sometimes a scam will leave you down right broke or if your lucky you have a large enough net worth and you can make the money back fast on your own.",
